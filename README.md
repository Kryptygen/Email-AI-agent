# Email-AI-agent
This agent acts as an intermediate between the receiver and sender. It automates the process of reading mail from the inbox, transforming it using an LLM into the desired output and finally sending the generated output back to the sender.  
Create an .env file since it provides the api key, your email addres, your email password, smtp server and imap server. Use the template given below which could be used to add in your credentials before the project is executed.
